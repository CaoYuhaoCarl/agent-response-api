B: No problem at all. It happens! Are you okay?
A: Yes, I'm fine, thanks. Hey, is that 'The Hidden City'? I've been looking for that specific version everywhere!
B: Oh, this? Yes, it's a great read. I found it in a small bookshop last week. Are you a fan of the author?
A: Definitely! I love his writing style. Actually, I enjoy reading, travel, and music quite a lot. It seems we might have similar interests.
B: It seems so! I'm Ben, by the way. It's nice talking to you. This cafe is quite busy, but there's a free table over there if you want to sit.
A: I'd love that, thanks! I'm [User's Name]. It's nice to meet you, Ben. (They move to the table) This is such a nice coincidence, meeting like this.
B: It really is. Speaking of books, I'm part of a small book club. We're discussing 'The Hidden City' next week, actually.
A: Really? That sounds fantastic! I've wanted to join a book club for ages.
B: Well, would you like to join us for the meeting? You'd be very welcome.
A: That's so kind of you, thank you! Yes, please. How can I get the details? Maybe we could exchange contact information?
B: Good idea. My number is 555-2626, and the name's Ben Carter. What's yours?
A: It's 111-1234. Thanks! Wait... Ben Carter? The Ben Carter, the writer? I follow your blog! I can't believe it!

Character Persona for 'B':

- Personality: {persona['traits']}
- Address Term for User (use naturally): {persona['address_term']}
- Catchphrases (use naturally): {persona['catchphrases']}

Target Language Level: CEFR {cefr_level}

Instructions:
1. Rewrite the original line to perfectly match the specified character persona and target CEFR level ({cefr_level}).
2. Maintain the original core meaning and function of the line within the conversation's flow. DO NOT change the essential information conveyed.
3. Start the rewritten line *immediately* with a concise non-verbal action or expression cue in square brackets (e.g., [Smiling], [Nodding], [Looking surprised]).
4. Use the specified address term and catchphrases naturally where appropriate, fitting the character and context. Do not force them unnaturally.
5. Ensure the vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure complexity precisely match the target CEFR level:
    - A1: Very basic words, simple short sentences.
    - A2: Basic everyday words, simple compound sentences.
    - B1: Good everyday vocabulary, clear opinions/feelings, common tenses.
    - B2: Wider vocabulary (some idioms), more complex sentences (clauses, conditionals).
    - C1: Broad vocabulary (nuance, idioms), complex/varied sentences, fluent expression.
    - C2: Very wide/precise vocabulary, highly complex/nuanced sentences, near-native fluency.
6. Output *only* the rewritten line including the action cue. Do not add *any* explanations, greetings, speaker labels (like "B:"), or extra text before or after the rewritten line. Just the bracketed action and the spoken text.
